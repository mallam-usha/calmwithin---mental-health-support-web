[View the live project here](https://mallam-usha.github.io/calmwithin---mental-health-support-web/)

This is the Mental health support website.It is designed to be responsive on a variety of devices and accessible from different web browsers, providing ease-of-use to potential viewers who wish to handle their mental health, help themselves in their mental struggles, help others who face mental struggles, or support campaigns promoting mental health awareness.

The goal for this project was to create a website where users with different needs can retrieve information on mental health without having to sift through multiple webpages.

Right now, it is difficult to find a single platform that offers educational value for people who have never faced or even heard about these issues and at the same time offers practical help for the ones who have a great deal of experience with such problems and are looking for ways on resolving them. A responsive and user-friendly website designed to provide mental health resources, self-care tips, and crisis support. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Since mental health issues are exceptionally prevalent in modern society, and since stigma leaves the victims of mental illnesses belittled, misinformed, and uneducated, we attempted to create a website within which users can access resources to educate themselves, help themselves, try the Exercises and set their mental health.

On this website, users can easily navigate across different pages to find the information that they are looking for depending on their interests within the area of mental health problems they are facing.

The Home page of our project will me very calming, as soon as you open it your brain becomes very peacefull and it lets you to login or register into the website and provide various Resourses, Exercises, Community and Helpline.

## 🌟 Why Mental Health Support Matters

1. The Global Mental Health Crisis
- 1 in 4 people worldwide will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime (WHO).

- Depression is the leading cause of disability globally, affecting over 280 million people (WHO, 2023).

- Suicide claims over 700,000 lives annually, with 77% occurring in low- and middle-income countries (WHO).

2. Barriers to Care
- Stigma & Shame: Fear of judgment prevents 60% of people from seeking help (Mental Health America).

- Limited Access:

    - High costs: Therapy averages 60–200 per session(U.S. data).

    - Provider shortages: Over 100 million people live in "mental health professional shortage areas" (U.S. HHS).

    - Cultural Gaps: Marginalized communities (e.g., BIPOC, LGBTQ+) face systemic inequities in care.

3. Digital Tools Bridge the Gap
- 24/7 Accessibility: Apps and websites provide immediate support during crises (e.g., midnight anxiety attacks).

- Anonymity: Reduces fear of judgment; 75% of users prefer anonymous mental health resources (JMIR Study).

- Cost-Effective: Free/low-cost resources democratize access to coping strategies.

4. Early Intervention Saves Lives
- 50% of mental illnesses begin by age 14 (NAMI). Early support improves long-term outcomes.
